AlpineJS app with an ExpressJS backend using PostgreSQL.


The **client** folder is a ViteJS app. I created vite app using the `npm create vite@latest` command and then renamed the folder ViteJS create to `client`.

The **server** folder is an ExpressJS app that was initialized using `npm init -y`.
